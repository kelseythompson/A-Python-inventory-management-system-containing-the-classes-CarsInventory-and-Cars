# Cars Inventory Management System

This project is a basic inventory management system for cars, implemented in Python. It provides an organized way to manage car information using two primary classes: `CarsInventory` (for managing the inventory of cars) and `Cars` (representing individual car objects). This system includes functionality to add, modify, remove, and display car details, and also allows for saving the inventory to a file.

## Classes Overview

### 1. `CarsInventory` Class

This class manages the car inventory by providing methods to add, display, remove, and modify car entries.

  - `Cars_dict`: A dictionary where each car is stored with a unique `car_ID` as the key and a `Cars` object as the value.
  
- **Methods**:
  - `__init__`: Initializes an empty dictionary for storing car entries.
  - `add_car(car_ID, car)`: Adds a car to the inventory using a unique `car_ID`.
  - `disply_dictionary()`: Returns a formatted string of the entire inventory.
  - `remove_car(car_ID)`: Removes a car from the inventory using its `car_ID`.
  - `modify_car(car_ID, car)`: Modifies an existing car entry.

### 2. `Cars` Class

This class represents individual car details and is used within the `CarsInventory` class.

- **Attributes**:
  - `brand`, `model`, `color`, `year`, `mileage`: Attributes for each car's details.
  
- **Methods**:
  - `__str__`: Provides a formatted string of the car's details for easy display.
